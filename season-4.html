			  			hile this might not make many top episodes lists, it is one of my personal favourites, and definitely struck a chord with me and my childhood and adolescence.</p>
			  		<p>
			  			Having never been grounded or reprimanded by not being allowed to do something until I was 17, I can definitely relate to a 10 year old Bart here! When I was 17, I was grounded, and was not allowed to go to the first 18th birthday party of the year in my secondary school. Everyone went except me, and the FOMO was torture. So I feel ya, Bart.</p>
			  		<p>
			  			This is the very first time we see Homer put the hammer down with Bart. Time after time, Homer would almost indirectly reward Bart’s bad behaviour. We see this at the start of the episode where Homer sprints upstairs to give Bart some Pizza that he was not allowed to have, on account of his bad behaviour.</p>
			  		<p>
			  			Following Bart’s latest stunt, involving breaking Grampa’s false teeth, Homer, sided by Marge, hands down an almighty punishment to Bart. He is not allowed to see the Itchy and Scratchy Movie. Gut-wrenching stuff for any 10 year old on the show to take. Homer vow’s to make this punishment stick.</p>
			  		<p>
			  			40 years into the future (only 10 years from now at my time of writing which is just a crazy thing to occur to me) we see Bart and Homer watch the show being replayed in the theatre. Bart is Chief Justice of the United States, Homer clearly set him on the right path with his punishment. They both watch and enjoy the movie. One of many tender father-son moments between the two.</p>

						This episode follows a science project by Lisa, to determine whether or not Bart is smarter than a hamster. But more prominently, the episode follows Homer’s quest for sobriety… for a month.</p>
					<p>
						It’s truly remarkable how a cartoon like The Simpsons, so accessible to children then and now, can deal with topics such as alcoholism, in such a humorous, yet frank and dignified way.</p>
					<p>
						Homers refusal and denial to go sober is hilarious, from screaming and fleeing from an AA meeting when told with their help, he’d never drink another beer again, to saying “no deer for a month” to Marge when she categorically requests for him to have “no beer for a month”.</p>
					<p>
						After the month has passed, and Homer is free to wet the whistle in Moe’s, he leaves after the first drink when he sees how the booze has affected those in the bar around him, namely Barney Gumble.</p>
					<p>
						Homer leaves, and goes for a bike ride with Marge, where they cycle into the sunset sining “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head’. Yet another tender moment that pulls at the heart-strings, between Homer and Marge.</p>
					<p class="ep4quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>
						<em>Rev. Lovejoy: Homer, with our help, you'll never touch a beer again.<br>
						Homer: Aaah! [jumps out the window]</em></p>

				<div class="episode3">
					<p>
						This episode revolves around Homer becoming president of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant’s trade union.</p>
					<p>
						Mr. Burns arbitrarily revokes the dental plan for employees, while reminiscing of simpler times in the workplace. A free keg of beer is offered to help sweeten the deal for employees, who seem to be fine with this.</p>
					<p>
						Homer slowly begins to realise he will have to pay for Lisa’s braces if they forfeit their dental plan. This paves the way for Homer and staff to lead the charge and go on strike, to have the dental plan back.</p>
					<p>
						The episode highlights strength in numbers, and the camaraderie of unions, and how they can be a force to be reckoned with. It is also one of many moments where Homer rises to the occasion and displays great leadership and negotiation skills, for all his faults.</p>
					<p>
						This episode also introduced me to ‘Classical Gas’, which I fruitlessly tried learning on guitar.</p>
					<p class="ep3quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>
						<em>Lenny: So long, dental plan!<br>
						(Homer looks blankly as the words echo through his mind)<br>
						Lenny's Voice: Dental plan!<br>
						Marge's Voice: Lisa needs braces! (Both lines repeated 8 times in Homer’s mind)</em></p>

				<div class="episode2">
					<p>
						In this episode, the town of Springfield is given a war chest of $3 million dollars from Mr. Burns, by way of a fine paid for illegal disposal of nuclear waste.</p>
					<p>
						It is discussed in a townhall meeting what is to be done with the money. Marge’s practical suggestion of fixing Main Street is dismissed by the townspeople. Enter smooth-talking stranger Lyle Lanley, who convinces the town, by way of a catchy musical number, to invest the money in a monorail system.</p>
					<p>
						Marge correctly suspects Lanley of being a scam artist. And before Lanley can flee the town with his monorail money, he is ambushed by some angry townspeople.</p>
					<p>
						The sheer density of laugh-out-loud gags in this episode is truly remarkable. From Lyle Lanley’s “intensive” monorail course, to Homer’s role as monorail conductor, to Leonard Nimoy’s hilarious cameo, the classic humour of The Simpson’s is perfectly bottled up in this episode.</p>
					<p class= "ep2quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>
						<em>Marge opens a closet in the monorail.<br>
						Marge: Homer, there's a family of possums in here.<br>

					<p>
						Yet another occurrence of Homer being betrayed by a close friend. First Moe, now Barney.</p>
					<p>
						Dan Castallaneta picked up his second Emmy for his outstanding voice-over performance as both Homer and Barney, amongst others.</p>
					<p>
						Homer really showing what an enigma he is here. For all his perceived stupidity and oaf-like behaviour, you cannot deny his drive and entrepreneurial mindset. Homer’s plow business is booming. Barney, who is struggling, confides in Homer for advice. Following Homer’s pep talk, Barney completely rips off Homer’s plow business in becoming the ‘Plow King’. He goes on to slander Homer with the help of Linda Ronstadt in a commercial, does it get any worse than that?</p>
					<p>
						Homer seeks revenge by sending Barney to dangerous territory for a “plow job”, but when Barney becomes in danger, a remorseful Homer rescues him.</p>
					<p>
						The status quo returns when Homer and Barney sort out their differences, the sun shines, melts all the snow, and Homer’s plow is repossessed. We can only imagine Barney and Homer out for pints off-screen the next day despite the episode’s events. The episode finished with a happy Homer and proud Marge.</p>
					<p>
						Another happy ending, but they are always done so well that it is hard to tire of them. A plot-rich and hilarious episode, with a great cameo performance by the late, great Adam West.</p>
					<p>
						One of my favourite episodes of all time.</p>
					<p class="ep1quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>
						<em>Woman: Could you make sure not to scrape my asphalt?<br>
