						eason 9. The end of the road for quality episodes as far as I’m concerned, and I know I am not alone on that.</p>
					<p>
						Coming in at number 5 for season 9 is Trash of The Titans. </p>
					<p>
						Homer’s laziness and hatred for taking out the trash leads him to challenge the current local government and implement his own trash collection services for himself. U2 also make an appearance in concert, and a few jars at Moe’s.</p>
					<p>
						After the Simpsons celebrate ‘Love Day’ in Springfield, the trash piles up. It doesn’t get taken out until it spills over, when Homer is forced to take out the trash. Homer insults the garbage men when they come by, and they refuse to take the Simpson garbage. It piles up over time until it disappears, and Homer thinks he’s won. But he hasn’t, Marge wrote a letter of apology to the sanitation commissioner, forging Homer’s name.</p>
					<p>
						Homer goes to retrieve the letter, and starts pointlessly arguing with commissioner Ray Patterson (voiced by Steve Martin). These aimless arguments lead to Homer taking a stand and running for commissioner to spite Patterson.</p>
					<p>
						After a slow start, Homer’s campaign gathers momentum with the slogan “Can’t someone else do it?”.</p>
					<p>
						Homer makes some absurd promises to the town in what the garbage service will offer should he be chosen as commissioner. The townspeople opt for the unrealistic promises over Patterson. However, the trash begins to pile up all over town and unearth itself.</p>
					<p>
						In an “I told you so” move, Patterson declines the chance to be reinstated. As the town completely fills with garbage, the entire town moves five miles down the road.</p>
					<p>
						The wacky promises, appealing to the lowest common denominator in the citizens of Springfield, telling everyone what they want to hear in order to win, is not to dissimilar from a certain successful US Presidential candidate in 2016.</p>

					<p>
						The episode starts off at Moe’s, where Barney is chosen as the designated driver in the gang by drawing a black pickled egg out of a jar.</p>
					<p>
						As Homer and the gang enjoy their drunken antics, Barney is twitching uncontrollably, not being able to tolerate everyone having fun on the booze.</p>
					<p>
						After their night of wild antics, Barney assures Homer that he will return his car to him in the morning. But Barney vanishes and two months later, Homer’s car is still missing.
						Barney returns back, in the turn of a limousine, hungover and still thoroughly drunk. A furious Homer demands to know where his car is. Barney cannot recall the last two months of his life.</p>
					<p>
						A letter eventually arrives, stating that Homer’s car is illegally parked in Manhattan. So the Simpson family make their way to the Big Apple.</p>
					<p>
						The Simpson family have a great time, except for Homer who has a torrid time. His day was spent staying put by his car, only to be given an additional ticket for using the bathroom in one of the world trade centre buildings. That’s what crab juice’ll do to ya.</p>
					<p>
						He spends the rest of the day trying to unclamp his car. He even tries to chew a bolt off. So he just drives on regardless.</p>
					<p>
						Homer had a New York agenda before having to go there to collect his car. That was very much reinforced after his visit.</p>
					<p>
						He is not a happy camper as he leaves. As somebody from the Irish countryside who had to go to Dublin occasionally, I feel his pain.</p>

				<div class="episode3">
					<p>
						This episode revolves around a crestfallen Homer, who seeks to better his physical condition. Bart becomes ashamed of him when Homer plays capture the flag on Bart’s team, among a group of kids. Homer becomes exhausted, and is pelted with eggs by the children.</p>
					<p>
						Homer takes a stand and joins a gym, despite not being able to even pronounce the word ‘gym’. He is given intense training by Rainier Wolfcastle, who “shouts slogans” at him to whip him into the shape.</p>
					<p>
						Homer gets into great shape thanks to the intense training, and a ‘Powersauce’ bar which has become his main power source. Homer won’t eat anything unless it is in bar form to unleash its’ awesome power. Homer tries and fails to eat spaghetti and meatballs in bar form, however.</p>
					<p>
						Rainier Wolfcastle is approached by two Powersauce representatives to climb the Murderhorn, the tallest mountain in Springfield. Wolfcastle denies, and Bart informs the reps that Homer is up to task. Homer agrees to this.</p>
					<p>
						Grampa convinces Homer not to do it as he tried to do it himself when he was younger, and was betrayed by a friend.</p>
					<p>
						Homer goes for broke, aided by two sherpas. Homer discovers the corpse of Grampa’s friend, and it is revealed that Grampa betrayed him, and tried to eat him.</p>
					<p>
						Horrified, homer calls it a day and sticks his flag on the plateau. This causes the peak to break off, making the plateau the new peak.</p>
					<p>
						Bart is beaming with pride, and he and Homer share a tender father-son moment. Which is comically cut short by Marge observing Homer’s wallet atop the mountain.</p>

					<p>
						A bored Homer seeks a career change. He’s only done so 100 times at this point, so he’s overdue a new venture.</p>
					<p>
						Homer gets fired from his job by placing a donut in the reactor. While lying on the couch at home unemployed, homer sees a recruitment ad for the Naval Reserve. Homer enlists, as Moe, Barney and Apu join him. Meanwhile, Bart is keen to impress everyone in school, so he gets his ear pierced.</p>
					<p>
						Homer and others soon graduate from the Naval Reserve. They are later forced to participate in the annual war games and are placed on board a nuclear submarine, under the command of Captain Tenille.</p>
					<p>
						Homer says his goodbyes to everyone, except Bart due to his earring. Bart reluctantly gives Homer the earring.</p>
					<p>
						Homer finds himself in charge as Captain Tenille is fired out of the torpedo sheet on Homer’s command. Homer being unaware he is there, of course. Then the fired at submarine retaliates, and Homer is forced to call the crew to retreat.</p>
					<p>
						The ship finds itself in Russian waters, and is intercepted by the US government as an attempt to defect. This causes tensions between the US and Russia, who reveal that the fall of the soviet union was just a ruse, and it still very much exists.</p>
					<p>
						The US Navy drops depth charges on Homer’s sub, aiming to destroy it or force it to surface. The explosion causes a pinhole leak in the sub’s wall. They look to be doomed, until Homer remembers Bart’s earring, which he uses to plug the leak and save the submarine and its’ crew.</p>
					<p>
						Upon surfacing, Homer is to be prosecuted. However, he is let off the hook because all of the officers at his hearing are under indictment for various offences. Homer receives a dishonourable discharge and forgives Bart, as the earring saved his life.</p>
					<p>
						Another nutty situation Homer just can’t help but be involved in. Gags a plenty in this episode.</p>

						We have now made it to the best episode of the last good season. Though season 9 would be the weakest out of 3-9, the gulf in quality between season 9 and 10 is just too large for me to consider any season after this one to be a “classic” season. Despite this, Season 9 had some great episodes, some not even on this list, but to me, this is the strongest Season 9 episode. Having said that, this would not make the top 10 overall. But despite this, it is an excellent episode with plenty of gags, and a hilarious yet accurate take on cults. Few digs thrown in at Scientology in this episode to name but a few. Then again, we have seen cult of personality take the fore in western civilisation in recent years, so this episode holds even more water now than it did when it was released.</p>
					<p>
						At the airport, Bart and Homer meet recruiters for the new religious movement, Movementarianism. A number of Springfield residents are invited to watch an orientation film. The film explains that “The Leader” will bring the Movementarians to a planet called Blisstonia, aboard a spaceship. Those present are now brainwashed into loving The Leader.</p>
					<p>
						Homer gets his family involved, and they all move into the compound. Marge is the only family member to not be brainwashed, and escapes the compound. With the help of Reverend Lovejoy, Ned Flanders, and Groundskeeper Willie, who have all resisted, the trick the brainwashed Simpsons into leaving the compound.</p>
					<p>
						Marge deprograms the kids with fake hover bikes. She almost has Homer too with a drop of beer, but before more than a drop can land on his tongue, Homer is recaptured by the Movementarians’ lawyers.</p>
					<p>
						Homer reveals himself to not be brainwashed anymore, and plans to reveal the Movementarian hoax to the crowd present. He brings them to the forbidden barn, where it appears that there is legitimately an impressive spaceship.</p> 
					<p>
						However, the crudely-made spaceship falls apart mid-air, showing The Leader with bags of everyone’s money.</p>
					<p>
						For me, this episode is on the money with cults, and dare I say it, some organised religion. Money, power and influence. It mocks these things in a light-hearted way though, and shouldn’t come across too offensive. In fact, Nancy Cartwright, who voices Bart, is a scientologist herself. As usual with The Simpsons, the humour outweighs the controversy.</p>
					<p class="ep1quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>
						<em>Reverend Lovejoy: This so-called "new religion" is nothing but a pack of weird rituals and chants designed to take away the money of fools. Let us say the Lord's prayer forty times, but first let's pass the collection plate.</em></p>
