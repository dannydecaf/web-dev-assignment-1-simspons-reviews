                o kick things off, we start with Stark Raving Dad. Homer is committed to a mental institution, by his employer. Why? For wearing a pink shirt to work, as a result of Bart leaving his lucky red hat in with Homer’s laundry. Standard enough, like. </p>
              <p>
                He strikes up a friendship with a fellow patient, who reveals himself to be the real Michael Jackson, only for revealing himself to be ‘Leon Kompowsky’ at the end. Michael Jackson did however, lend his voice for the episode, under the credited alias of John Jay Smith. Lisa being serenaded for her birthday by Jackson and Bart, is up there with one of the most wholesome Simpson’s moments. </p>
              <p>
                However, following renewed allegations of sexual abuse against Michael Jackson in March 2019, the episode was pulled from circulation.</p>

                Sideshow Bob, Bart’s arch-nemesis, has earned an early release from prison for being a model prisoner. He has been locked up since framing Krusty the clown, memorably foiled by Bart. Bob becomes involved with Selma Bouvier following a “Prison Pen Pal” scheme. </p>
              <p>
                They eventually arrange to get married. Bob’s motive however, is to murder Selma. Bart again foils this, sending Bob back to prison, fueling the animosity between Bob and Bart, which remains prominent for many seasons. </p>
              <p>
                This is the first time we see Grammer showcase his brilliance in providing the voice for Sideshow Bob. So evil, conniving, when I was a kid I was legit terrified of Sideshow Bob! </p>

                One of the first episodes of the Simpsons I remember watching as a kid. </p>
              <p>
                Bart receives a microphone, which can be used to transmit sounds to AM radios. As a prank, Bart lowers a radio down a well, and uses the microphone to dupe the townspeople into thinking a kid by the name of “Timmy O’ Toole” is trapped there. </p>
              <p>
                Bart remembers that a label containing his full name is on the radio, so he tries to retrieve it and becomes trapped. </p>
              <p>
                After realising they were duped initially, the townspeople refuse to help Bart who is now legitimately stuck down a well. </p>
              <p>
                Fantastic use of ‘The Boy Who Cried Wolf’ in this episode, and a great performance by Sting who plays himself in the episode, and helps in rescuing Bart. </p>

                  A tale of a friendship torn by greed and plagiarism.</p>
                <p>
                  Business is slow at Moe’s Tavern. Homer tells Moe about a drink he concocted when forced to watch slides of Patty and Selma’s vacation. Homer gathers the dregs of some liquids lying around the house. Drops of liquor, a bottle of cough syrup, accidentally ignited by cigarette ash dropped in by Patty. “Fire made it good” exclaims Homer. </p>
                <P>
                  This gives Moe food for thought, and eventually sells it at his bar. It becomes a sensational hit, and Homer is furious at Moe’s betrayal and blatant plagiarism.</P> 
                <P>
                  Homer hilariously exacts his revenge by dementedly revealing the secret of the drink to patrons at Moe’s, standing high on the roof, covering half his face, in an homage to ‘Phantom of the Opera’.</P>
                <P>

                  One of the greatest episodes of all time, simply sensational TV.</p>
                <p>
                  The Springfield power plant soft ball team is in bad shape, but fortunes are soon reversed thanks to Homer’s enchanted Wonder Bat, which he make from a fallen tree branch. Thanks to the magic of this bat, they enjoy an undefeated season and earn a place in the championship game against the Shelbyville plant. This is one of the first times we get to see the fierce rivalry that exists between Springfield and their neighbouring town, Shelbyville.</p>
                <p>
                  To ensure victory, Mr. Burns secures the services of many top stars. All but 1 of them fall victim to some wacky mishaps. Darryl Strawberry is the only player of the newly recruited stars that can play, leaving Homer benched as they play the same position.</p>
                <p>
                  Homer is given his moment to shine however, and is knocked unconscious by the first pitch, forcing in the winning run.</p>
                <p>
                  A terrific episode that encapsulates all that is great about sports movies. The triumphant success, the mishaps. Terrific song that plays over the ending credits too, this episode just had everything. Quality.</p>
