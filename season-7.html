						he second and final instalment in the ‘Who Shot Mr Burns?’ series.</p>
					<p>
						The episode unmasks the gunman. But before doing so, Burns’ trusty assistant Waylon Smithers is wracked with guilt, convinced that he is the one who tried to shoot Mr. Burns.</p>
					<p>
						It is apparent that almost everyone had a motive for shooting and killing Burns, but a prime suspect emerges in the form of Waylon Smithers.</p>
					<p>
						Smithers was highly intoxicated on the night, and felt moments of rage overpower him to the point where he wanted to harm Burns. Smithers confesses to who he thinks is Reverend Lovejoy in the church confession box, but it is revealed that Chief Wiggum was there in an attempt to nab the gunman by way of confession.</p>
					<p>
						Homer also becomes a suspect when his name is mentioned by Burns when he awakes. Homer tries to silence Burns by showing up at the hospital, threatening his boss not to say his name. Burns cannot help it however, and “Homer Simpson” is all he can say. Probably due to the fact Homer really hammers his name home to Burns after many instances of not knowing it!</p>
					<p>
						Eventually, both Homer and Smithers are cleared of any wrongdoing. This is because the gunman was in fact, a gunwoman. Maggie Simpson, to be precise. This naturally sent shockwaves across the world, as very few had suspected her.</p>
					<p>
						Having said that, all the clues were there. This was far from a rushed ending to the two-parter. It is incredibly intricate, and serves as a satisfying finale to a gripping two-parter. No gags or humour was spared either in maintaining the tension and suspense.</p>

				<div class="episode4">
					<p>
						After conducting a prank on the First Church of Springfield, Bart sells his soul to Milhouse for five dollars. Bart comes to regret his decision, and goes on a desperate quest to regain his soul.</p>
					<p>
						This episode also features one of my favourite subplots in the series.</p>
					<p>
						As a subplot to Bart’s quest to get his soul back, Moe tries to expand his customer base by turning his bar into a family theme restaurant. The stress of running the business by himself ultimately unnerves him.</p>
					<p>
						Everything about ‘Uncle Moe’s’ restaurant was hilarious. Moe was clearly out of his depth, and it is clear from his rude, but obscenely funny outbursts that he is simply not a people person. Moe has to revert back to the old tavern after he snaps at a little girl and terrifies her at the restaurant.</p>
					<p>
						Meanwhile, Bart starts to experience some unusual phenomena. He firmly believes it is down to him selling his soul. He tries to retrieve it from Milhouse, but Mihouse tells Bart that he traded it in to Comic Book Guy at his store.</p>
					<p>
						It is then revealed that Lisa bought Bart’s soul from Comic Book Guy, so he could give it to Bart.</p>
					<p>
						One of the more somber and dark episodes of The Simpsons, but certainly a memorable, and highly quotable one.</p>
					<p class="ep4quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>
						<em>At Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag, Lisa says grace.<br>
						Lisa: Lord, have mercy on my soul, and Mom's soul... and Dad's soul... and Maggie's soul... and let every soul in Christendom...<br>
						Frustrated, Bart throws a meatball at Lisa.<br>
						Marge: Bart!<br>
						Bart: I can't take this anymore! I want my soul, and I want it now! [runs out]<br>
						Homer: Bart! You didn't finish your spaghetti and Moe balls!<br>
						Homer's brain: Silence, you fool. It can be ours!<br>
						Homer shovels Bart's spaghetti into his mouth.<br>

				<div class="episode3">
					<p>
						After faking his own death to get out of work (contemplated this myself more times than I’d like to admit), Homer becomes acquainted, or reacquainted with long lost mother, Mona, brilliantly voiced by Glenn Close.</p>
					<p>
						Writers and fans alike have described this episode as the  perfect combination of real emotion, good gags, and a captivating story. While all episodes in this list tick various boxes, this is one that ticks them all.</p>
					<p>
						Homer reconnects with his liberal, “hippy” mother, who went on the lam after a protest group she was part of, detonated an antibiotic bomb in a germ warfare laboratory owned by Mr. Burns.</p>
					<p>
						However, their reunion is cut somewhat sort as Mona must go back into hiding again, following Chief Wiggums enrolment in the police academy. Wiggum, who was a security guard at Burns’ lab, is later revealed to be the tipster who tipped Homer off on the FBI’s pursuit of Mona. The FBI were hot on her trail after Burns had recognised Mona and called the FBI.</p>
					<p>
						Homer and Mona share an emotional farewell, which ends with Homer sitting pensively on his car, gazing into the sky as the sun sets and the sky fades to night. A truly compelling and beautiful scene, never fails to pull on the heart strings.</p>

				<div class="episode2">
					<p>
						Homer finally gets everything he’s ever wanted, only to realize he can’t find the ANY key. That, in a nutshell, is the plot of “King-Size Homer”.</p>
					<p>
						Aided by his own son and a quack physician, Homer endeavours to gain weight in order to gain a disability and work from home. He succeeds in doing so, perhaps this weight gain wouldn’t have been so important to Homer 26 years into the future, with remote-working being the norm almost everywhere, pretty much.</p>
					<p>
						Marge and Lisa attempt to talk sense into Homer, warning him that it is highly detrimental to his health. Marge also says she is less attracted to Homer physically, which upsets him, but not enough to deter him from wanting to stay working at home.</p>
					<p>
						Disaster strikes when Homer leaves a drinking bird to press the Y key, while Homer goes to watch a movie, which he is not allowed to attend due to his size, which is a safety hazard. The plant is on the verge of nuclear meltdown, unless Homer performs a manual shutdown.</p>
					<p>
						Homer successfully performs the manual shutdown, albeit finding himself stuck in the gas storage tank in doing so.</p>
					<p>
						The episode certainly has an anti-obesity message, but it is thinly veiled. It is conveyed by the humorous insight into the plight of the fat man.</p>
					<p>
						The episode ends with Burns giving homer an exercise routine that he won’t adhere to (why is The Simpsons too damn relatable to me). So he decides to just pay for Homer’s liposuction instead.</p>
					<p>
						Homer is so lazy in this episode, he goes to great lengths and endures more hardship than he normally would have, just to stay lazy. True dedication to laziness.</p>
					<p class="ep2quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>
						<em>Homer: Hey, where's Charlie? How'd he get out of this?<br>
						Carl: Uh, he's at home on disability.<br>
						Lenny: Yeah, he got injured on the job and they sent him home with pay. It's like a lottery that awards stupidity.<br>
						Homer: Stupidity, eh?</em></p>

				<div class="episode1">
					<p>
						A masterpiece. 22 shorts, cleverly and intricately interwoven into one another. Life in Springfield seems to be pretty full-on for everyone, is it possible to have a normal day there?</p>
					<p>
						There are far too many vignettes to go into detail on here. But we see the immortal ‘Steamed Hams’ scene, where Skinner invites Chalmers to dinner, and it ends in catastrophe, is by far my favourite.</p>
					<p>
						It is regarded as one of the most iconic moments of the show, despite not featuring any Simpsons family members. It has been the subject of many a meme online, it still holds up to this very day.</p>
					<p>
						An unfortunate series of events sees Skinner set his house ablaze. His roast becomes ruined, so he heads off to the nearby Krusty Burger, to pawn off some burgers as his own cooking, thinking that Chalmers would be none the wiser. How wrong he was.</p>
					<p>
						Chalmers quizzes Skinner on the food, and Skinner seems to have an answer to every question. It almost seems as if Chalmers is buying it.</p>
					<p>
						Chalmers catches a glimpse of the kitchen on fire, but Skinner reassures Chalmers that it is Aurora Borealis, but he is not allowed to see it. He somehow buys this too, and leaves the Skinner house which is clearly on fire. It is not clear here whether Chalmers is oblivious to the fire, or is just blasé about it and wants to flee from Skinner’s company.</p>
					<p>
						A good chunk of the other vignettes draws notable inspiration from ‘Pulp Fiction’. In terms of value per minute of episode, 22 Short Films gives the most bang for your buck. 22 shorts in less than half an hour is no easy feat. One of the most impressively crafted episodes of The Simpsons, or indeed any cartoon and TV show for that matter.</p>

						<em>Lou: Y'know, I went to the McDonald's in, uh, Shelbyville on Friday night.<br>

						Lou: Uh, the McDonald's restaurant. I never heard of it either, but they have over 2,000 locations in this state alone.<br>
						Eddie: Hmm. Must have sprung up overnight.<br>
						Lou: You know the funniest thing though? It's the little differences.<br>
						Chief Wiggum: Example.<br>
						Lou: Well, at McDonald's you can buy a Krusty Burger with cheese, right? But they don't call it a Krusty Burger with cheese.<br>
						Chief Wiggum: Get out… well what do they call it?<br>
						Lou: A Quarter Pounder with cheese.<br>
						Chief Wiggum: A Quarter Pounder with cheese? Well I can picture the cheese, but… uh. Do they have Krusty Partially Gelatinated Non-Dairy Gum Based Beverages?<br>
						Lou: Mmm hmm, they call 'em Shakes.<br>
						Eddie: Huh, shakes. You don't know what you're gettin'.</em></p>
