						ed Flanders has a reputation in Springfield as being a Steady Eddie, or Steady Neddy if you will. Always the cool, calm and collected voice of reason. Puts up with the antics of a certain next door neighbour, so you just know he has the patience of a saint. But just how impenetrable is his patience? We find out in emphatic fashion within this episode.</p>
					<p>
						A violent hurricane strikes Springfield. By chance, the only home destroyed is the Flanders home.</p>
					<p>
						As a gesture of goodwill, the townspeople rally together to help rebuild the Flanders home, much to the delight of the Flanders family.</p>
					<p>
						However, the shoddy workmanship, and sheer unliveable state of the home, causes Ned to snap.</p>
					<p>
						Ned is sent down a path of insanity, and he loses faith in God, and the townspeople around him. This breakdown is nothing short of spectacular, and stuns the entire town. Stuns us as viewers too, to a greater extent. His rant at the townspeople in the vicinity of the neighbourhood is gripping television. You just would not expect this from Ned Flanders. He absolutely roasts every last one of them, including less-deserving roastees like Marge.</p>
					<p>
						Following this rant, Flanders checks himself into a mental institution. It is revealed he hates his parents, and had received treatment at the institution as a child for being out of control. This treatment was responsible for Ned’s inability to express rage, up until he lost his home.</p>
					<p>
						Flanders becomes cured, and is greeted by the townspeople outside of the hospital.</p>
					<p>
						One of the most shocking moments of the series was Flanders fire and brimstone roasting of the townsfolk. It is part shocking, and part hilarious. The insult directed at Lenny was my favourite, and one I continue to quote with friends. “I don’t know who you are, but I’m sure you’re a jerk!”.</p>

				<div class="episode4">
					<p>
						Prohibition has hit the town of Springfield, following some scenes of pure debauchery on St. Patrick’s Day (pretty tame by Irish standards but how and ever).</p>
					<p>
						Bart inadvertently gets drunk by free beer sprayed by a Duff parade float, which funnels down Bart’s novelty horn.</p>
					<p>
						Bart as an underaged kid, being drunk and captured on national television was the straw that broke the camel’s back.  A group of women complain to mayor Quimby to have all alcohol banned. The keeper of the old town laws discovers a Prohibition law that has been around for 200 years, but has never been enforced. Quimby’s hand is forced, and alcohol is banned in Springfield.</p>
					<p>
						Alcohol is still in circulation however, through mafia distributions, and a nearby speakeasy (Moe’s Tavern) disguised as ‘Moe’s Pet Store’. When Wiggum is spotted at the ‘Pet Store’, the women in the protest group are appalled, and demand a new police chief be brought in to enforce the law. Enter ‘Rex Banner’.</p>
					<p>
						Rex Banner is a no-nonsense police chief, in stark contrast to Chief Wiggum.</p>
					<p>
						Despite Banner, homer figures out a way to keep Moe’s in operation by becoming a bootlegger.</p>
					<p>
						He fills blowing balls up with beer brewed in the Simpson basement, and has them transported via the Bowl-A-Rama, and then to Moe’s for consumption. Ye another absolute masterstroke from Homer, it may be time to admit that Homer is smarter than he lets on, even Marge is impressed by Homer’s cleverly thought out plan.</p>
					<p>
						Homer eventually runs dry. He encounters Chief Wiggum, and they arrange for Homer to be taken in by Wiggum. Homer does not escape with a light punishment, as was initially expected. Instead he is to be catapulted out of Springfield. But before Banner can send Homer on his way, Banner is instead catapulted by standing in close proximity while giving the town a lecture. Furthermore, it is revealed on the old document that the prohibition was repealed a year later, meaning Homer is free to go.</p>
					<p>
						Alcohol is in circulation again, and all is well in Springfield. "To alcohol! The cause of... and solution to... all of life's problems."</p>
					<p>
						In my books, Rex Banner is up there with one of the great one episode wonder characters. His old-timey, dry wit, straight shooter personality is a stroke of writing genius. The character being heavily influenced by Eliot Ness, more specifically, Robert Stack’s portrayal of Ness in ‘The Untouchables’.</p>
					<p class="ep4quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>
						<em>Rex Banner: (grabbing Ned Flanders) Are you the Beer Baron?<br>
						Ned Flanders: Well, if you're talking about root beer, then I'm guilt-diddily-ilty as char-diddily-arged.<br>
						Rex Banner: (to the other cops) He's not the Beer Baron, but he sounds drunk; take him in.</em></p>

					<p>
						After Homer eats several Guatemalan insanity peppers at the annual chili cook off, his consciousness goes on a mystical journey, complete with a talking coyote spirit guide, to discover his soul mate.</p>
					<p>
						Marge tries everything to keep Homer from attending the cook off, including smoking to mask the smell. Homer soon notices the smell of chili however, when he steps out for some fresh air. He jumps into his favourite pair of chili boots, and the family is convinced to go to the cook off.</p>
					<p>
						Homer is revealed to be a seasoned chili critic. His opinion is highly revered in the town, and everyone is keen to impress Homer. Homer has an impressive ability to withstand hot foods, so this is especially tough.</p>
					<p>
						Homer tries Chief Wiggums chili, after coasting through chili from Ned Flanders. Homer is overcome by the intense heat of the pepper from Guatemala. Marge is angry and embarrassed by Homer’s reaction to the pepper, and storms off.</p>
					<p>
						Homer later discovers that candle wax can protect his mouth from the spiciness of the pepper. He does this, and the town are amazed as Homer eats several peppers in quick succession. Homer feels accomplished and on top of the world, but not for long.</p>
					<p>
						Homer hallucinates like crazy, and enters a bizarre, desert-like world. He meets a space coyote voiced by the late great Johnny Cash, and is instructed to find his soul mate. Homer is certain it is Marge, but the space coyote isn’t so sure.</p>

						Homer eventually finds that his soulmate is Marge, as he makes his way to a lighthouse where Marge comes to get him. They embrace, in a tender moment in the closing scene.</p>

					<p>
						As a big fan of Rodney Dangerfield and his one-liners, the episode is essentially a platform for his Dangerfield’s stand-up comedy.</p>
					<p>
						Dangerfield plays the role of Larry Burns, Mr. Burns long lost son. Larry was the result of a one-night stand with the daughter of a former flame at a reunion. Burns is overjoyed to have a son and treats him as his protege. But the honeymoon period fizzles out when Larry shows his true, boorish colours. Larry befriends Homer at work, where it is revealed that they have plenty in common. However, at a dinner party, Burns disowns Larry, saying that he wishes he had no son.</p>
					<p>
						Larry, at Homer’s insistence, is the subject of a “fake kidnapping” to see if Burns truly loves his son. They are hard pressed to get Burns to admit this so plainly.</p>
					<p>
						They are spotted when they leave the house, and are chased by police into a standoff. Homer gives a heartfelt speech justifying Larry’s actions. The hearts of the townspeople are melted, including Mr. Burns. But Burns still cannot have Larry in his life, but Larry is ok with this as he confirms he has a wife and kids, that he had forgotten about after telling them he went for coffee a week ago!</p>
					<p>
						Dangerfield was at his brilliant best in this episode, the one-liners in this episode are as good if not better than the one-liners he used in his stand up routines. Pure insult comedy and self-deprecation at its’ finest. And a couple of touching, vintage heartfelt Simpsons moments for good measure.</p>
					<p class="ep2quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>
						<em>Larry: Well, how 'bout it, Pop?  I know it's tough, but can you love me for what I am?  [cops a smirk]<br>
						Burns: Uh... well... uh... [hugs Larry]  There there, sonny boy. I suppose I have been a bit... <br>
						Oh, no, I can't do it.  It's just not me.  I'm sorry, Larry.  I can't be the family that you need.<br>
						Larry: Aw, that's okay.  I got a wife and kids.  Oh, that reminds me. They're probably wondering where I went. <br>
						I told 'em I'm going for coffee.  That was a week ago.</em></p>

				<div class="episode1">
					<p>
						This episode is right up there with the best of ‘em. A close second to ‘Cape Feare’ in my books.</p>
					<p>
						The episode is basically what every Simpsons fan is thinking. How does Homer have it so cushy? How has he been in so many unrealistic, grandiose situations? Well this episode makes light of this viewer frustration, and does so superbly.</p>
					<p>
						Frank Grimes is a new employee at the power plant. He is a down on his luck, uptight individual. He is fully qualified, come across highly intelligent, organised and motivated - everything that Homer Simpson does not come across as, basically.</p>
					<p>
						Grimes is displeased with Homer’s work ethic, laziness, and general behaviour and conduct. He grows to resent Homer very quickly. Meanwhile, in the episode’s subplot, Bart buys a factory for a dollar, but it collapses, making no money.</p>
					<p>
						Grimes lets his feelings known to colleagues, and Homer himself, about Homer’s lack of work ethic. Homer doesn’t seem to be faxed at all, which infuriates Grimes further.</p>
					<p>
						Grimes is invited to the Simpson home for dinner. He is in awe of the house, and the general setup Homer has going for him. He is stunned and harbours extreme resentment at Homer’s accomplishments, his home, the fact Bart had a factory at the time, lobsters for dinner, and so on and so forth. Grimes, unable to hides his jealousy and resentment, leaves abruptly.</p>
					<p>
						Grimes resentment turns to ntense hatred, and has a meltdown when Homer wins a contest at the power plant, but for children. He is dumbfounded at how everyone is happy for Homer in his victory.</p>
					<p>
						Grimes becomes irrational, and eventually fatally electrocutes himself by mocking Homer’s stupidity and carelessness.</p>
					<p>
						Grimes funeral ends in laughter as Homer is asleep, and asks Marge to change the channel. A rue black comedy of an episode, the humour in the episode tends to overshadow Grimes’ death completely.</p>
					<p>
						I think we all see a bit off Frank Grimes in ourselves… just me then? Ok. I mean, we all know of someone who has landed perfectly on their feet with minimal to no effort, while most of us toil away to make ends meet. That is the overall sentiment of this episode, echoing viewer frustration at how Homer has stayed alive as long as he has, how he is able to afford all his lavish goods, and the list goes on. This episode was the perfect response to this frustration.</p>
					<p class="ep1quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>
						<em>Grimes: I'm sorry, isn't that …<br>
						Homer: Yes, that's me, and the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford…..And this is when I was on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins….. <br>
						Oh! And here's a picture of me in outer space.<br>
						Grimes: You? Went into outer space? You?<br>
						Homer: Sure. You've never been? Would you like to see my Grammy award?<br>
						Grimes: No! I wouldn't!</em></p>
