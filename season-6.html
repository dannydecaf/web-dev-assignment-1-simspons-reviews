		  				his episode aired in Oz when I was only a young lad living there. Although not old enough to fully remember the hysteria surrounding its’ release, I do remember it being discussed in school, by my parents at the dinner table. It was a huge talking point at the time, and divided opinion among Australians. Some loved it, some hated it. Letters of complaint were sent to Matt Groening’s desk, regarding the accents used. It was more South African sounding than Australian. Also, no true blue Aussie would dream of touching a can of Fosters.</p>

		  			<p>
						Bart is indicted for fraud in Australia, and the family has to travel down under so he can apologise.</p>
					<p>
						He makes a collect call to Tobias Drundridge, who he picks out Bart picks out at random. He asks what direction his, and his neighbour’s toilet water is going.</p>
					<p>
						When Tobias’ father Bruno discovers the bill for “900 dollarydoos”, he becomes irate and angry at Bart, who taunts him.</p>
					<p>
						Bruno then gets the Australian government involved, and it all kicks off from there.</p>
					<p>
						Bart is poised to take a kick from a giant boot worn by the Prime Minister through the embassy gate, but Bart dodges the kick and taunts those at the embassy.</p>
					<p>
						The Simpson family flee the country, with Bart’s bullfrog having reproduced thoughout the country, destroying the ecosystem and farm. The Simpsons take delight in this, unaware that a koala has stowed away on the helicopter en-route to U.S. territories.</p>
					<p>
						My recollection of this episode being aired in Australia and hysteria surrounding it, is what earns this episode a spot in the top 5 this season.</p>
					<p>
						There are also numerous great gags, satirising Australian culture in Mad Max and Crocodile Dundee to name a few.</p>

					<p>
						In this episode, Homer finds himself being accused of sexual harassment, albeit falsely.</p>
					<p>
						This was quite a heavy topic for a family cartoon comedy to deal with. However, the issues of sexual harassment and voyeurism were dealt with quite well, and highlighted it as a serious issue not to be taken lightly, despite Homer’s innocence.</p>
					<p>
						Homer finds himself in this sticky situation, after grabbing a gummy Venus de milo from the backside of a babysitter that he was dropping home from the Simpson home. The babysitter, Ashley Grant, interpreted this as sexual harassment, although Homer was innocently just trying to get some candy.</p>
					<p>
						The episode follows the trials and tribulations of Homer’s defence, which is bolstered by Groundskeeper Willie’s video footage of “couples in cars”, which has the footage of Homer grabbing the gummy candy, thus clearing his name.</p>
					<p>
						The episode certainly had some important messages, but it did not fall short in the comedy department. The media circus that followed Homer was hilarious, from news anchors assuming a rotating chicken is Homer, to the Rock Bottom series that sensationalised the story. As well as being funny, it highlights the sometimes reactionary behaviour of media.</p>
					<p class="ep4quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>

					<p>
						The first of a ‘whodunnit’ two-parter, revolving around the shooting of Mr. Burns. The second part being aired as the first episode of the next season, sweeping the world into a frenzy of trying to figure out the identity of the gunman.</p>
					<p>
						It was through this two-parter that I became more interested in crime-based mysteries on television and in literature, it was genuinely riveting stuff, even as a 5 year old!</p>
					<p>
						Monty Burns is up to no good as usual. Springfield Elementary has struck oil, and Burns cannot stand the fact that a non-profit institution has its hands on some oil money. Therefore he plots to tap the oil well, and steal it for himself.</p>
					<p>
						The drilling operation has caused havoc in the town of Springfield, and Burns solidifies his villain status with this stunt. Every single person wants his head on a spike.</p>
					<p>
						It doesn’t stop there, he intends to block out the sun, forcing the town to rely on the electricity from his plant.</p>
					<p>
						A lot of townspeople then disappear, and it is not clear at this point why. Burns gleefully revels in his fiendish acts, but is then shot. We do not see or hear who the gunman is. A number of people notice Burns collapsed on a sundial, concluding the episode and season with a thrilling cliffhanger, which for me has helped earned this episode the accolade of 3rd place in what is arguably one of the greatest seasons of the entire series.</p>

					<p>
						In this episode, the Children of Springfield try to retrieve their beloved lemon tree after it is stolen by the children of Shelbyville.</p>
					<p>
						The importance of town pride is really hammered home in this episode. Bart takes heed to this after writing his name in wet cement, and being told off by Marge. He then begins to take pride and joy in living in Springfield, getting riled up by anti-Springfield taunts by the townspeople of the neighbouring Shelbyville.</p>
					<p>
						Grampa explains that the rivalry goes back to the establishment of the two towns, by Jebediah Springfield and Shelbyville Manhattan, who was a proponent of cousin marriage.</p>
					<p>
						The Springfield lemon tree is stolen by the boys from Shelbyville, and Bart leads a gang og peers to retrieve it. The tree is located in an impound lot, The boys fathers who were leading a search for their sons, find them, and they convene in attempting to retrieve the lemon tree. The boys and their fathers are successful, and are given a heroes welcome. They are lauded in one of Grampa’s tales as the “Heroes of Springfield”, and they celebrate with lemonade. Meanwhile, the Shelbyville boys drink turnip juice to “celebrate” the revocation of the “haunted” lemon tree.</p>
					<p>
						This episode truly has the makings of a movie, in my opinion. It’s like The Little Rascals meets Mighty Ducks, or something. The camaraderie and solidarity between friends in the name of town pride, and the sweet taste of victory. A true adventure of an episode, that is not short on gags either.</p>
					<p class="ep2quote">

					<p>
						Episode of the season. Perfect balance between laughs, and heartfelt emotion. Realistic, reliable, relatable.</p>
					<p>
						Homer recounts the birth of Maggie, and the events leading up to the birth, in response to Bart and Lisa questioning why there are no baby photos of Maggie.</p>
					<p>
						Homer had done what many of us stuck in a 9 to 5 they don’t particularly adore want to do, by calling it a day in emphatic fashion. Let’s face it, who wouldn’t want to play the bongos on a tyrant bosses head?</p>
					<p>
						Homer was on cloud nine with his new job at the bowling alley. Sure, he took a pay decrease, but he was happy.</p>
					<p>
						However, Homer discovered that Marge had become pregnant. This was quite upsetting to him, as it meant he would have to give up his current job and ask for his old job back, or look for a raise at the alley.</p>
					<p>
						He quit the job at the alley following an unsuccessful stunt of firing a shotgun into the air, to attract more business, and allow for Homer to be paid more at the alley.</p>
					<p>
						Homer then goes back to the plant, tail between his legs, and is given the job back. Mr. Burns presents him with a plaque reading “Don’t forget, you’re here forever”. This compounds Homer’s misery.</p>
					<p>
						Despite the despair, Homer instantly falls in love with Maggie when she is born. Homer covers the plaque at work with baby photos of Maggie, so that the plaque now reads “Do it for her”. A truly touching moment, and a testament to How good a father Homer truly is that he has sacrificed his happiness in his career for his beloved daughter.</p>

						(Homer drives through the plant and everyone cheers as Homer continues playing)<br>
						Carl: Yeah, way to play the boss's head like a bongo, Homer!<br>
						Lenny: He's getting a pretty good sound out of that guy.</em></p>
