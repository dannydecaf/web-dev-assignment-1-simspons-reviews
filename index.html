              ince its’ debut in December 1989, The Simpsons has become one of the most watched and beloved TV programmes of all time.
              Prior to the 1989 TV debut of The Simpsons, our favourite yellow family appeared in short clips on the Tracey Ullman Show, with the first short debuting in 1987.
              The Simpsons have been around longer than I, and many other adoring fans have been on this earth. 
              Very few cultural products have had as much shelf-life as The Simpsons have had up until this very moment, and counting. 
              The Simpsons to this day, continue to make more and more episodes, with no end in sight! 
              That’s highly impressive, if not disenchanting for a more purist audience. </p>
            <p>
              In my own humble opinion (which happens to be pretty widely shared), the overall quality and appeal of The Simpsons came to a screeching halt at the season 10 mark.
              It can be argued that a number of different factors were in play during this decline.  </p>
            <p>
              The Simpsons started to veer off course in an attempt to keep up with the emergence of more zanier shows like Family Guy and South Park.
              The show, and the characters within the show lost a lot of soul with this change in direction. Homer remained a buffoon, but became a more vindictive buffoon.
              In fact, he had been dubbed ‘Jerkass Homer’ during this period. The surrealism in the scenarios, and humour of the characters was jacked up to Family Guy levels, which simply did not work.
              Apples and oranges. </p>
            <p>
              The Simpsons started to make the transition to digital animation, which came into full effect circa 2002. In my opinion, this was a horrible mistake.
              The rough and readiness, as well as the colouring in the older episodes greatly contributed to the watchability of the show.
              Though there were a couple of artistic mistakes here and there, this is one of the many nuances that made The Simpsons great. It was easy on the eye.
              The effort to advance to digital became jarring and dull, and coupled with the lack of quality, to me, makes the show almost chore-like to watch. </p>
            <p>
              There was also significant turnover and rotation in the writer’s room which contributed to the loss of the show’s classic humour.
              If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! The show lost a lot of heart and soul. The heart-warming moments which were prominent in the show’s golden era, simply disappeared.
              It no longer became endearing. </p><br>

              could continue my rant indefinitely, but instead of slating what the show has become, I would like to highlight what I believe to be the show’s greatest seasons, and their greatest episodes in those seasons. Don’t get me wrong, seasons 1-2 were great, but it is my opinion that The Simpsons really and truly came into its’ own from Season 3. Season 1-2, as great as they are, were still very much formative seasons in terms of character development, storylines, and animation to name only a few things. Season 3 saw the solidification of all of these elements, as well as the classic humour which was sustained up until the Season 10 mark. The chart below is a good reference point in pinpointing the decline. As you can see, this is not only just a matter of opinion, but a matter of fact. Just have a look at those ratings. That's a <em>lot</em> of orange and red post-Season 10: </p><br>

              Disclaimer: this is merely my opinion. But from years of never missing a brand new episode of The Simpsons until around 2004, I would like to think it is a well-informed one. :) </p><br><br>
