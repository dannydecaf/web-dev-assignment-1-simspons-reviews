		  				his episode revolves around the harsh firing of Principal Skinner, by Superintendent Chalmers, who most certainly has an agenda against Skinner, which is apparent in every episode they are in together.</p>
		  			<p>	
						Things go awry during a show and tell, where Santa’s Little Helper gets stuck in a vent. Chalmers is not happy with how things are being ran in Springfield Elementary, and does not hold back in slating the school. Having said that, the school certainly isn’t up to snuff on the basis of unfortunate events that take place during Chalmer’s inspection.</p>
					<p>
						Chalmers, in a somewhat of a knee-jerk reaction, fires Skinner. However, when Santa’s Little Helper falls into the grasp of Chalmers, his heart is softened and he forgives Skinner. That is until,  a greased scotsman arrives on the scene. A greased up Groundskeeper Willie who tried chasing Santa’s Little Helper, falls onto Chalmers, which negated the good-will he showed to Skinner from seeing a loveable dog as opposed to a greasy, gruff scotsman. Hence Skinner is definitively fired.</p>
					<p>
						The episode shows great insight into Skinner’s life that we normally wouldn’t have seen. We see how much of a mother’s boy he still is at his age, we learn about his career in the military. This is all done by Bart feeling guilt, and befriending Skinner. Their friendship, as unsuited as it may seem, was done so brilliantly. They shared a very wholesome friendship, which laid bare Skinner’s home life, which is far from ideal for a man of his age.</p>
					<p>
						Skinner gets his job back at the expense of Ned Flanders, and he and Bart talk about the friendship they shared, and how it will be unlikely to continue given Skinner’s reinstatement, and the likelihood of Bart becoming a good student, very slim.</p>
					<p>
						A great story of unlikely friendship.</p>

						At a Springfield Swap Meet, Bart and Lisa spot Homer on the cover of an LP album. Homer tells them that he recorded this in 1985 with Principal Skinner, Barney and Apu.</p>
					<p>
						Homer proceeds to tell the tale to his family of how the album came to fruition.</p>
					<p>
						The story is not unlike any rise to fame story associated with bands like The Beatles. Full of ups and downs, ins and outs. Chief Wiggum was in the former lineup, but was sacked as the agency that took their band on, did not want him in.</p>
					<p>
						They hired Barney Gumble, after unexpectedly hearing some dulcet tones from him on the men’s room floor. They then dubbed themselves ‘The Be Sharps’.</p>
					<p>
						They became a cultural phenomenon, but in the music business, what goes up must come down. They were no longer “hot” according to magazines and newspapers. So they decided to split up and revert to their old livelihoods.</p>
					<p>
						They performed a reunion gig on the top of Moe’s tavern, akin to The Beatles’ rooftop concert of their Apple Corps headquarters.</p>
					<p>
						The episode contains a wealth of references from music and band culture which I loved. One of the greats.</p>

				<div class="episode3">
					<p>
						The first, and only appearance of a Treehouse of Horror episode on the list.</p>
					<p>
						Not that they weren’t all great, this one is just at the top of the pile for me, and I’d be hard pressed fitting a Halloween special in a top 5 of a season that has over 20 episodes of quality.</p>
					<p>
						Many iconic scenes in this episode, including but not limited to Flanders as the devil, and Homer stuck in hell being given “all the donuts in the world’. Which was of no consequence to the donut eating machine that is Homer Simpson.</p>
					<p>
						Lionel Hutz’ appearance in defending Homer for the right to not be kept in hell was a particular highlight for me. His slapstick incompetence as a lawyer is sidesplittingly hilarious.</p>
					<p>
						The gremlin episode/segment didn’t rank so high for me, but the episode of Burns’ portrayal of Dracula was too funny. Definitely the most vampire like human being in the Simpson’s universe so the role was such a perfect fit. He even finds a way to recompose himself from dust briefly, just to tell Homer he is fired. Hilarious!</p>

						Mr. Burns in touch with his feelings, showing a secretive side? Surely not.</p>
					<p>
						Well this episode certainly suggests that Mr. Burns, like all of is, is very much human.</p>
					<p>
						A teddy bear from Mr. Burns’ childhood finds its’ way into the arms of Maggie Simpson. Burns had previously had nightmares, lamenting his cherished bear.</p>
					<p>
						Burns’ tries a variety of tactics to get him back, including somehow appearing on a sitcom with Smithers, to demand the bear from the Simpsons at the end.</p>
					<p>
						He is reduced to begging Maggie for the bear back. Maggie does not relent, but has a change of heart and give the bear back to Burns. In this wholesome moment, Burns is over come with delight and promised to be nice and do good from now one. That went well, eh?!</p>

				<div class="episode1">
					<p>
						<em>Thee</em> best of the best. An absolute masterpiece in cartoon comedy, while still solidly possessing thriller-like tension. Another episode that scared me as a kid, and still to an extent had me on the edge of my seat in adulthood.</p>
					<p>
						Sideshow Bob is on the loose again, after being granted parole. He sets his sights on his arch-nemesis, Bart Simpson.</p>
					<p>
						The episode is heavily influenced by the 1991 film ‘Cape Fear’. Sideshow Bob’s character drawing inspiration from Robert De Niro’s character as the villain in the film.</p>
					<p>
						This episode really shows what Kelsey Grammer brings to the table with his incredible voice acting. The voice of a heinous villain is done so well by him, you wouldn’t think it was coming from Frasier Crane.</p>
					<p>
						Sideshow Bob is a truly terrifying character, or at least he was when I was a kid. But perfectly balanced by dry wit and slapstick humour makes him such a brilliant character.</p>
					<p>
						Bob’s murderous plot, almost like for like with the film of (almost) the same on the boat, is highly tense for the viewer while still churning out nuggets of light-hearted comedy.</p>
					<p>
						As per usual, Bob’s plot is foiled by Bart’s delay tactics. He is apprehended by the police, but this won’t be the last we see of him, that’s for sure.</p>
					<p>
						My favourite episode fo the entire series.</p>
					<p class="ep1quote">
						<b>Best Moment</b><br><br>
						<em>Bart: Take him away, boys.<br>
						Chief Wiggum: Hey, I'm the chief here! Bake him away, toys.<br>
						Lou: What'd you say, Chief?<br>
						Chief Wiggum: Do what the kid says.</em></p>
